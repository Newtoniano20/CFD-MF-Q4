# CFD-MF-Q4
 

## Intro
This is the source code for a project related to a Fluid Mechanics Assignment. We are supposed to do some CFD using OpenFoam, gmsh and Paraview.

## Requirements
For this project, we used:

- Paraview
- OpenFoam
- GMSH

## Explanation

The N1 folder contains the example files we where given as a template for this project. The N2 folder, is the first attempt at the task. Why N + Number? Because It is Test Number 1, so the N is "Number". The N3 is the third attempt and from it we built what's inside the Final directory, where we have both subsonic and supersonic results with mesh + geo files used.
